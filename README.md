# Defining Departments in Python

## Setup:
mkdir -p workspace/python/orientation/bangazon && cd $_
touch bangazon.py

##Explanation:
I created a Department Class with some simple properties and methods on the class of Department.  I also created some derived classes that inherit from the Department class (e.g. name, supervisor, employee_count, etc.)
